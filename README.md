### About The Project

Software to Assess the Viability of Seedling Trays

This project was a collaboration with a team of four other students to develop a program using OpenCV, a software library for image processing, to calculate the viability of vegetable seedling trays.
My focus was on contributing to the software’s front end with Svelte. This project was presented to the client and a panel of judges during UC Merced’s annual Innovate to Grow event, emphasizing the program's success in delivering an automated solution for assessing seedling tray viability.
